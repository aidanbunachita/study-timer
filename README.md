# [ver. 0.2] **study-timer**: Simple Timer-with-GUI using the *Threading* and *Tkinter* modules. 

## I. Description
### The **study-timer** is a customizable timer program that helps you focus while working.
<br>

#### It stays on top of whatever you're working on and allows you to start sequences of timers via shortcuts. It changes to **Blue** when a timer-sequence is on; once it ends, it turns **Red** and asks if you want to repeat the timer-sequence or go to **Idle**: a grace-period timer during which you can decide which timer-sequence to start next. It's *highly recommended* that you create your own timer-sequences (in *StudyTimer*.py) and assign practical meaning to them. 
<br>

#### My personal study routine, for example, involves 3 passes through whatever it is I'm studying. During each pass, I'm only allowed to spend a certain amount of time on each 'Chunk' of work - that is, any self-contained problem or explanation that I come across. Once that's up, I force myself to leave a highlight on that Chunk and return to it only during the next pass. The **Chunk**, **Pick-Off**, and **Review** timer-sequences are for those 3 passes. Additionally, each timer in a timer-sequence has a corresponding action I have to do when it fininshes. All this stops me from 'standing still' while reading and helps me be more deliberate while studying.
